# Generative AI Content Generator üåü

This project is a web application built with Streamlit that leverages Google Generative AI to create content based on user inputs. It offers a user-friendly interface for interacting with powerful generative models.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Versatile Input Options:** Generate content based on either:
    * Text prompts
    * Uploaded images
* **Model Selection:** Choose from various Google Generative AI models.
    * **Important:** It's recommended to use current models like `gemini-1.5-flash`. Please note that older models (e.g., Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision, deprecated July 12, 2024) may no longer be available or supported. Always check the [Google AI documentation](https://ai.google.dev/docs) for the latest model information.
* **Stylish User Interface:** Features a modern look with a vibrant, color-changing wavy background and bold text styling.

## üöÄ How It Works

1.  **Select Model & Input:** Choose your preferred Generative AI model and specify whether you'll provide a text prompt or upload an image.
2.  **Provide Input:** Enter your text prompt in the designated field or upload your image file using the uploader.
3.  **Generate:** Click the "Generate Content" button.
4.  **View Output:** Watch as the AI crafts creative content based on your input, displayed in real-time!

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Framework:** Streamlit
* **AI Engine:** Google Generative AI (Gemini models)

    ```
    *(Ensure you have `streamlit`, `google-generativeai`, `Pillow`, and any other necessary libraries listed in `requirements.txt`)*
3.  **Configure API Key:**
    * Obtain your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    * Set up the API key. This is often done via environment variables (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) or a Streamlit secrets file (`.streamlit/secrets.toml`). Refer to [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/secrets-management) and [Google AI](https://ai.google.dev/docs/setup) documentation for best practices.
4.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run your_app_script.py
